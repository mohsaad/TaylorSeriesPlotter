TaylorSeriesPlotter
===================

Simple way to plot Taylor series expansions in Mathematica.

Open and run. You have a lot of transcendental functions to use, and you can choose the number of terms of expansion as well as the center point. 

This was made by me about 2 years ago in 2012, before my senior year.
